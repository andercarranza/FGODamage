    <string name="dmgplusexplain">DamagePlusAdd is a modifier that adds a set amount of damage to your attack. This damage is not affected by any modifier and there is no skill that solely gives bonus damage plus.
        For some examples of this modifier: Waver\'s third skill gives some along with an ATK mod, and Divinity is a form of DamagePlusAdd. There is no skill specifically for DamagePlusAdd but when it is applied
        in skills it looks just like the Power Mod applied</string>
